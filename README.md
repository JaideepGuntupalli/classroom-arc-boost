# Dark Side of Classroom

An opinionated arc browser boost which turns on Google Classroom's dark mode. 

## Overview

Boost let me enjoy using Google Classroom by creating a unique and memorable look for the website. It can also help to make the website more visually appealing and easier to navigate.
