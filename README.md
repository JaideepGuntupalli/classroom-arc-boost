# Dark Side of Classroom

An opinionated arc browser boost which turns on Google Classroom's dark mode. 

## Overview
The boost customizes the Google Classroom Platform with dark mode, custom fonts, and improved styles. Boost let me enjoy using Google Classroom by creating a unique and memorable look for the website. It can also help to make the website more visually appealing and easier to navigate. Additionally, it helps create a consistent look and feel across all website pages, making it easier for me to recognize and remember the website. Finally, who doesn't like dark mode?

Protect yourself by picking the dark side!
